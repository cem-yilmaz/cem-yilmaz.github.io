Hello! I'm Cem, a 4th Year undergraduate at The University of Edinburgh. I have a passion for solving large complex tasks involving real-world data, such as Data Science, Machine Learning, or Natural Language Processing. I also enjoy creating and managing websites for other people.

This website exists more as a complete collection of my projects and thoughts. If you'd rather see a more *condensed* overview of my achievements, consider viewing my [CV](/cv/).
