# I've made a website. Why?
Everyone has to start somewhere.

I see this website as a place to publish my ideas. I needed somewhere to archive long insights into my thought processes, advice I'd give my younger self (_especially the guy who started University almost 4 years ago_), and anything else in between.

Additionally, it's just nice to have a website on the internet that I've got enough control over to integrate into my tools/workflows. 8-year old me would be so excited if he saw this.
# What can you expect to see on this website?
## Blog
See above.

Any of my friends know I quite enjoy the art of rambling, and I've developed quite a skill for it over the years.

I often write how I would talk, incorporating informal mannerisms and often prioritising telling an engaging story over a concise one. You have been warned!
## Projects
Any big portfolio piece I'm a meaningful part of. I have many of my own personal projects, but unfortunately they usually fall into the category of "data manipulation and analysis involving hyper-sensitive personal data", and as such I don't publish them in full.

The best of my projects are located in my [CV](/cv/), but this leaves me with a place to talk about even the smallest projects I'm proud of.
## Anything else?
This is literally the first post on this site. _Everything I've said here is subject to change_, and I may decide to go back on all of this and instead post pottery for the next 10 years.
