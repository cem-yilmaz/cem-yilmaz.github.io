August 12th, 2023. This was the day I stumbled upon [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbsAQSIKQXk) by *No Boilerplate* about a program called **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** that I'd never heard of before. 

Obsidian is a free Markdown editor with an emphasis on linking notes together to form connections. It's garnered quite a lot of popularity in the past year or so especially amongst tech-savvy users, which I attribute to it's "almost open-source" nature.

Obsidian *isn't* open-source. It's free for personal use (companies must pay for the commercial license, although I'm unsure if this is only enforced to the same standard that *WinRAR* would do so), but offers such a [rich plugin system](https://docs.obsidian.md/Home) that you could probably add any feature that you want to.

I'm not about to tutorialise Obsidian here as there are plenty of video tutorials on YouTube that do a much better job than I could ever hope to achieve. This post is intended to describe *how I currently use Obsidian to take notes in university*, so hopefully people - potentially students - willing to take the plunge with Obisidian can take the advice I wish I'd known when I started. 

Of course, following a retrospective[^skip] look into how I've taken notes during my time here at uni.
# A brief history of note-taking
## First Year
I started university with a spring in my step and a notebook in my pocket. No, seriously[^rb].

Look, I'd taken a year out due to Covid in September 2020, and aside from working an unmotivating job, I'd only been keeping mentally stimulated by completing the Codeacademy full-stack web developer course that I said I didn't have the time for earlier. **Translation**: I hadn't needed to take notes on a educational course in ages.

I bought a laptop for university but still, during my first few weeks, handwrote every single note for every single lecture. In the same notebook. With no external labels or organisational system at all. Writing all this down and looking at it now, it's a miracle I academically did well this semester at all.
## OneNote
While I can't remember exactly how I found OneNote, it was probably through a mix of two factors:

- My university uses Microsoft's Office suite of products and OneNote has been used to share files in the past, particularly in my first and second years
- I kept seeing students whip out iPads and get all the benefits of handwritten notes, while being able to seamlessly combine the official course materials

I simply made one notebook, and different tabs (or whatever they call them) for each course. I'd make a note for each lecture, paste the slides in, and annotate them - just like the iPad students!

I then found it rather difficult to keep up with the lectures in mathematical-notation-heavy lectures, and so got a drawing tablet, which OneNote provided excellent support for. Finally, I could not only handwrite whatever I wanted, but duplicate it, move it around, and erase on the fly!

The honeymoon didn't last long. When revising, it took me ages to find the relevant topics. Additionally, inserting extra images in was a faff. Most of the problem, however, originated from me: many of my notes consisted solely of the lecture slides with little more than a few extra sentences sprinkled in. I was hardly engaging with my lectures; honestly, in the case of simple "`Insert PDF`" jobs, I wouldn't say I engaged with them at all. Something needed to change
## Disclaimer
It must be said that I am **not** criticising all the methods mentioned in this post. I know several people who still religiously use OneNote throughout their undergrad. I've seen final years using Microsoft Word for their lecture notes. **The best note-taking system is ultimately the one which works for you, and I'm not about to convince you otherwise**.  
## Briefly, Notion
I tried Notion for a bit. During the following summer, I experimented with changing my note-taking workflow in anticipation for the uni year ahead. 

I'm not about to sit here and pretend Notion is bad, because that would be a lie. It's a key tool for countless people who effectively use it for tasks beyond the complexity of mine.

I just didn't like it.

I think Notion subscribes too strongly to a "style-over-substance" mantra. You've got built in support for UnSplash banner photos on notes, but you can't cleanly export the notes as Markdown. You can add emoji icons to notes, but you must choose from one of 8 pre-defined hex codes if you want a block colour banner. You've also got constant pop-ups for features as you type, sluggish performance, and for all the praise it's databases get, you can't simply insert a link to a note as the value to a cell![^workaround]
# Obsidian
It was at this point I found Obsidian, and everything just worked. I had an app that

[^skip]: The contents page is just to the left if you don't fancy all of that.
[^rb]: This section mainly exists as the "rock bottom" of note-taking, if I'm being honest.
[^workaround]: You *can*, technically. You can insert a type of page, which I called the same name as the note I intended to link to, and on that page you can add a text body which contains a link to the note. If this was confusing to read, then imagine the UX behind figuring it out!
